    <!-- Css Positioning -->

    <!-- Css positioning is a crucial aspect of web design that allows you to control the placement
    of elements on a wb page.There are several css properties for positioning, including float, position
    and display.

    1.Float:
    The Float property is used to move an element to  the left or right, allowing content to flow
    around it. It's often used for creating multi-column layouts or wrapping text around images.

    ELements with float applied are taken out of the normal document flow and moved to the left
    or right until they encounter the edge of their coutaining element or another floated element.

    Common values for float are left and right.

    It's important to clear floats using thr clear property on elements following the floated elements
    to prevent layout issues.

    2.Positioning:
    The position property allows you to contral the positionig of an elemnt relative to it's containing elements
    It Offers several values:
        Static (default):The element follows the normal flow of the document.
        relative:The element's position is relative to its normal position
        absolute:The element's position is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
        fixed:The element's position is relative to the viewport(stays in the same place even when scrolling).

    3.Display:
    The display property contrals the rendering behavior of an element.It can change an element's display
    from the default block or inline to other values like inline-block or none.

    Common values include:
        Block:Elements are displayed as a block-level elment, occupying the full width of their parent and stacking vertically.`
        Inline:Elements are displayed as an inline elements, stacking horizontally.
        Inline-block:Elements are displayed as inline elements, but you can contral their width,height and even margins.
        none: Elements are hidden, effectively removing them from the layout.
        flex and grid:Enable advanced layout options, such as creating flexible boxes and grid layouts.
